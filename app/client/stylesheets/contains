    globals.css
Global css classes to add to html tags

    base.css
Base styles include setting heading sizes, default link styles, default font styles, and body backgrounds

    layout.css
Major layout styles such as header and footer are traditionally styled using ID selectors but take the time
to think about the elements that are common across all components of the page and use class selectors where appropriate.

    module.css
Modules sit inside Layout components. Modules can sometimes sit within other Modules, too. Each Module should be
designed to exist as a standalone component.

    state.css
A state is something that augments and overrides all other styles. For example, an accordion section may be in a
collapsed or expanded state. A message may be in a success or error state.

    theme.css
Themes can affect any of the primary types. It could override base styles like default link colours. It could change
module elements such as chrome colours and borders. It could affect layout with different arrangements. It could also
alter how states look.
